# 001 - AI and MLOps

## Introduction
Welcome to the Hackathon of AI and MLOps! We will focus on hands-on activities that develop proficiency in AI-oriented services such as AutoML Vision, AI Platform, and MLOps pipeline. These challenges assume an introductory to intermediate knowledge of these services, and if this is not the case, please spend time working through related resources.

## Use Case
Smart Solutions Inc. plans to implement a face recognition solution to be used as an alternative to authenticate users into its internal online systems. The solution needs to be automated as much as possible to reduce human errors and costs. 

## Learning Objectives
Most challenges observed by customers in these realms are in stitching multiple services together. As such, we have tried to place key concepts in the context of a broader solution.

Once all hackathon challenges are completed, you should be able to:
- Configure your apps to call GCP APIs with API Key or Access Token
- Build a Web application that calls various GCP APIs, specifically Vision API and Cloud Storage API  
- Effectively leverage the AutoML Vision to create image classification model that can then be leveraged by the Web application
- Implement ML pipeline to manage dataset, model training and model deployment
- Deploy the Web application and trained model to Kubernetes 
- Automate the infrastructure and service provisioning with Cloud Build, Terraform, etc.
