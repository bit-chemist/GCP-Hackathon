# GCP Hackathon Workshop

The Hackathon Workshop is a set of challenge based hackathons that can be hosted in-person or virtually online.

Attendees work in a team of 3 to 5 people to solve a series of technical challenges for a given technology or solution scenario. Challenges describe high-level tasks and goals to be accomplished. Challenges are not step-by-step labs.

The Hackathon Workshop is designed to be a collaborative learning experience.  Attendees "learn from" and "share with" each other. Without step-by-step instructions given for the challenges, attendees have to "figure it out" together as a team.  This results in greater knowledge retention for the attendees. 

The attendee teams are not alone in solving the challenges. Coaches work with each team to provide guidance for, but not answers to, the challenges.  The coaches may also provide lectures and demos to introduce the challenges, as well as review challenge solutions throughout the event.
